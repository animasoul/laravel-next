English Teacher\n\nTues & Weds nights from 5pm-9pm\n\nAsk us about our $2,000 SIGNING BONUS for new recruits teaching in the areas of:\n\nSpecial Education, Secondary Math, Secondary Science, and World Language!\n\nEPS serves more than 8,000 students in a supportive community of 50,000.\n\nDistrict Administration Magazine recently named EPS a national District of Distinction for its unique and effective community partnerships. In 2014, we completed $99 million of renovations and construction across the district, including the addition of two new elementary schools. Local voters generously approved this year another $93 million to provide schools with more classrooms, safer entrances, improved technology and facilities to meet the needs of students in athletics and fine arts. The district promotes innovative learning and the use of technology, offering iPads, Chromebooks and SMART Boards. The latest bond issue provided 1:1 devices for all students.\n\nIn 2013, EPS, a National Math and Science Initiative district, opened its University Center on the Enid High campus. With an extensive slate of college dual credit and Advanced Placement courses, its academic program can save students more than $30,000 in college expenses. The school’s AP enrollment has quadrupled in the last few years.\n\nOur youngest students benefit from developmentally appropriate full-day Pre-K classes, including an intergenerational program. A local fundraising campaign and foundation grant recently garnered $250,000 to create Enid’s first early childhood center. We also have a learning lab for four- year-old students on the campus of NWOSU-Enid. The heart and soul of our district is our highly effective teaching staff and support team. Through Professional Learning Communities, they continue to strengthen instruction and encourage development – for themselves and for students.\n\nIn addition to a dynamic public school foundation, the district has a significant number of volunteers who help make our schools better places to learn. In the last six years, the community has donated more than $6.5 million in private funds to EPS for special projects.\n\nThanks to input from our team members, parents, students and community, we're in the third year of a dynamic three-year strategic plan that will lead our district into the future. We hope you will consider joining us on the journey!",
